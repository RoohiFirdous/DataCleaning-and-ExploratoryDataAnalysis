Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis on Trending Youtube Video Statistics
This Data Science project aims at analyzing the daily YouTube trending videos datasets.
The dataset is available at:

YouTube maintains a list of the top trending videos on the platform. This data set includes several months of data 
on daily trending YouTube videos. Data is included for the USA, Great Britain, Germany, Canada, France, Russia, Mexico, 
South Korea, India and Japan. This list is determined by using user interactions such as views, comments and likes to 
identify which videos are preferred by user and displays them on the trending page. Ranking of these videos is done based
on a ratio of views, likes, comments and shares, in order to display the best videos at the top of the page. We used the 
data sets available and began the process of data cleaning followed by Exploratory data analysis (EDA). 
By doing this project I learned about:

1. Data Cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis

-> Ratio of likes-dislikes in different categories?
-> Users like videos from which category more?
-> Top 5 videos that are on trending in each country?
-> Is the most liked video also the most trending video?
-> Maximum number of days to trending status for a video?
-> Users like videos from which category more?
-> Users comment on which category the most?
-> Frequently occurring words in tags and description
